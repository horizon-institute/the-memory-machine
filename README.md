# The Memory Machine
Android application for [The Memory Machine 2.0 project](https://www.horizon.ac.uk/project/mema-2-0/).

The Memory Machine aims to contextualise personal memories (pictures, videos, music, 3D content) into timelines to create personalised digital souvenirs, digital repositories for the end-of-life, engaging tools for personal reflection, history education, reminiscence interventions for dementia care, and tools for accessing cultural heritage. The Memory Machine, as a digital platform, provides the tools to allow creation and curation of memories that enable meaningful artefacts to be brought to life with rich emotional value.
